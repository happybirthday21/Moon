someone's special birthday! Someone who brightens up my world and always makes me smile! ü•∞
From the very first you understood me so well that it felt like we knew each other for a long time! And maybe we did at the study halls, huh? :P It's a mysterious story but also interesting, sweet and romantic with you. I couldn't wait to talk to you when something exciting happened. I wasn't afraid of being imperfect. So I could share with you my childhood fantasies, the dreams I haven't reached and the embarrasing events of my life. You listened with so much care that I wanted to share more. You were my prince on a white horse, and I'd be your princess with Loch Ness Monster as a pet. And everything is the same now and will be.. Today you've been 7691 days in this world and I'm the most glad about it because I was there with you in 149 days of it: Just next to my amazing partner and boyfriend. And for celebrating your awsomeness in your 21st birthday I made this for you to wish you a very happy birthday: Paljon onnea! I love you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
