From the very first you understood me so well that it felt like we knew each other for a long time! And maybe we did at the study halls? :P It's a mysterious story but also interesting, sweet and romantic with you.
And from the very first, I couldn't wait to talk to you when something exciting happened. I wasn't afraid of being imperfect. So I could share with you my childhood fantasies, the dreams I haven't reached and the embarrasing events of my life. 
You always listened with so much care that I wanted to share more. Now you're my prince on a white horse, and I'm your princess with Loch Ness Monster as a pet. Today you've been 7691 days in this world and I'm the most glad about it because I could share 149 days of it, just next to my amazing partner and boyfriend.
And for celebrating your awsomeness in your 21st birthday I made this for you to wish you a very happy birthday: Paljon onnea!

I love you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
